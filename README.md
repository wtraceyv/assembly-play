Small explorations in assembly code

-----
### Folders

Different folders are just for different syntax or extensions of assembly. I expect to only be working with 64-bit, but I started with AT&T syntax for kind of historical and comfort reasons (I kind of agree that `<cmd> <source>, <dest>` is a little more intuitive than the other way around like in nasm and whatnot).

If I'm going to do any actually interesting operations then I'll probably move to nasm or something in keeping with the times.
